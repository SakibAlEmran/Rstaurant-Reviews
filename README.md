# Restaurant-Reviews
In this project, I have used Nodejs and Express for backend, React for frontend and mongo altas for database. Mongo atlas provides sample database, I have used sample_restaurants database for this project. A client can make a:
1. GET request for restaurants, restaurant by restaurant Id. 
2. POST request to create review.
3. PUT request to Edit review.
4. DELETE request to delete review.
5. Query in database by name, zipcode and cuisine.
