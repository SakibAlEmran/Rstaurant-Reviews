# Restaurant-Reviews
In this project, I have used Nodejs and Express for backend, React for frontend and mongo altas for database. Mongo atlas provides sample database, I have used sample_restaurants database for this project. A client can make a:
1. GET request to get restaurants list,restaurant by restaurant Id. 
2. POST request to create review.
3. PUT request to Edit review.
4. DELETE request to delete review.
5. Query in database by name, zipcode and cuisine.

There is a dummy login system before creating, updating or deleting reviews.

## How to run this project in your machine
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SakibAlEmran/Rstaurant-Reviews.git
```
2. Go to backend directory and install node dev dependencies
3. create a .env file in backend directory and provide the RESTREVIEWS_DB_URI, RESTREVIEWS_DB_NS and PORT variable value.
4. go to frontend directory and install node dev dependencis
5. Start the backend server.
6. Start the frondend server. By default react listen to 3000 port. It will open in the browser automatically, the url wil be: http://localhost:3000/
